% --------
% use funnelsAxial06.mph to setup COMSOL model simulating light propagation through the funnel
% use funnelsAxialScript01.m to run the model and create the field/transmission data for particular funnel geometry
% use funnelsPlot.m to post-process the data
% remaining matlab functions are used to support the calculations
